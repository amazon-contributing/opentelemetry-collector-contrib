  When using compressed payloads, the Collector would verify only the size of the compressed payload. 
  This change applies the same restriction to the decompressed content. As a security measure, a limit of 20 MiB was added, which makes this a breaking change. 
  For most clients, this shouldn't be a problem, but if you often have payloads that decompress to more than 20 MiB, you might want to either configure your
  client to send smaller batches (recommended), or increase the limit using the MaxRequestBodySize option.
